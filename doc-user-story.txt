1. User & Problem Analysis

Primary User Profiles:

Content Marketers & Copywriters: Need to iterate on headlines, summaries, and ad copy quickly.

Technical Writers & Bloggers: Refine draft sections into more polished or varied versions.

Students & Academics: Rewrite essays or abstracts for clarity and style variations.

Core Problem:
Users waste time manually rephrasing or restructuring text. They lose momentum switching between drafts and struggle to maintain context when generating multiple versions. They need a seamless, step‑by‑step workspace that keeps each iteration visible and connected.
