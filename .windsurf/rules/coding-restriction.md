All JavaScript code is in the js/ directory, organized into pages/, components/, and utils/.
This project uses Vue via CDN in index.html. Write Vue components as ES modules in js/, and mount them to DOM elements as needed.
Do not install any npm or Node.js libraries. This is a pure frontend project—no package managers or build tools.
Use ES6+ syntax. Each file exports a single default function/class/component.
Use relative imports within js/.
index.html is the only HTML entry point. No inline JavaScript except minimal bootstrapping.
Do not add script tags for individual JS files in index.html; only reference the Vue CDN and entry JS.
Place all assets in a dedicated assets/ directory.
Follow this structure for all new code. Deviations require team review.
